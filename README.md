To create a resource group in Terraform, you can use the `azurerm_resource_group` resource if you are working with Azure. Below is an example of how to define a resource group using Terraform:

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}
```

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. Define the Azure provider.
2. Use the `azurerm_resource_group` resource to create a resource group.
3. Set the `name` and `location` attributes for the resource group.

To apply this configuration, follow these steps:

1. Save the above code to a file (e.g., `main.tf`).
2. Initialize Terraform: `terraform init`
3. Plan the changes: `terraform plan`
4. Apply the changes: `terraform apply`

This will create a resource group named `example-resources` in the `West Europe` location.
